# 3D-fractal-generation
a self led investigation into the mathematical properties of fractal art, including python scripts to generate 2D and 3D models.
tetrahedron.py generates the sierpinski pyramid as a 3D object. The mod value should be set to 2 and i suggest 32 layers for reasonable compute time.
the output is an STL file, viewable through any STL viewer. shown is my fractal after 3D printing the file.

interestingly generating 2D fractals with different mod values on the binomial expansion result created intricate and different patterns:

I've lost the 2D code but you can replicate the effect in 3D on the tetrahedron file.

The imaging script is something i wrote up to hack my objects and any image file into minecraft. here is that:

this was my first ever difficult coding project and showed me how maths and art and computing all link up and how beautiful that can be.
