# 3D-fractal-generation
a self led investigation into the mathematical properties of fractal art, including python scripts to generate 2D and 3D models.
tetrahedron.py generates the sierpinski pyramid as a 3D object. The mod value should be set to 2 and i suggest 32 layers for reasonable compute time.
the output is an STL file, viewable through any STL viewer.
